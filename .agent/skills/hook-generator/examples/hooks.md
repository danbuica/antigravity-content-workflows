# Hook Generator Examples (v2.0)

## Topic: Antigravity vs Claude Code (Expert/Comparison)

### Option 1: Result-First Detail
"I've been using Claude Code for the last two weeks for almost all my scripts, but yesterday I tried to port a full production workflow into Antigravity. I managed to get it running—including browser interactions—in under 12 minutes. If you're struggling to decide between the terminal-first approach of Claude and the integrated environment of Google, there's a very specific difference in how they handle execution that you need to see before you commit to one."

### Option 2: The Practical Story
"I recently sat down to build a lead generation agent. I started with Claude Code because, honestly, the writing speed is incredible. But about an hour in, I hit a wall with multi-tool orchestration. I switched over to Antigravity, and I want to show you exactly why the way Google handles 'Vibe Coding' made the difference for this specific project. It’s not about which tool is smarter; it’s about which one actually lets you ship."

## Topic: Beginner Guide to n8n Agents (Beginner)

### Option 1: The Transformation (Result-First)
"Most people think you need to be a senior developer to build an autonomous AI agent, but I just built a system that handles every email in my inbox using n8n without writing a single line of code. It took about 20 minutes to set up. If you're just starting out and the idea of 'Agentic AI' sounds complicated, I'm going to break it down into three simple steps today so you can have your first agent running by the end of this video."

### Option 2: Value Hook (Immediate Demo)
"Look at this. This is an n8n workflow I built this morning. It monitors my YouTube comments, analyzes the sentiment, and drafts a reply in my style—all automatically. In this video, I'm going to show you how to set this up from scratch. We aren't going to talk about high-level theory; we're just going to build it."
