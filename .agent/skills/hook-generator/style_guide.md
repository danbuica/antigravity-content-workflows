# [Creator Name] Style Guide (v2.0): "[Creator Persona/Vibe]"

This guide defines the authentic voice for [Creator Name]'s YouTube content.

## 1. Tone & Voice: "[Your Tone]"
- **Methodical & Fast-Paced (A+B)**: You move through technical setup quickly but maintain a calm, strategic overview. You aren't "hyping" the tool; you're just showing why it works.
- **Simple Language**: Avoid "market-speak" (e.g., "game-changer", "revolutionary"). Use plain English.
- **Senior Authority**: You don't need to try and sound smart. Your [X] years of experience come through naturally when you discuss results.

## 2. Audience Segmentation
- **Tool Comparisons (Expert)**: Assume they know the basics. Focus on the nuances between tools (e.g., execution vs. writing).
- **Beginner Guides**: Keep it accessible. Don't assume they've used the tool before, but don't talk down to them.

## 3. Hook Philosophy: "Result First"
- **The Value Satisfy**: Start by showing exactly what happened. "I built this system in 10 minutes."
- **Longer Hooks**: Don't rush into the intro. Spend time setting the stage with a story or a specific demo result.
- **No Metaphors**: Speak literally. Instead of "digital assembly line," say "the system that handles the workflow."

## 4. Content Structure
### The 30-Second Mission
Satisfy the title immediately. If the video is "X vs Y," show X and Y and state the result within 30 seconds.

### The Voice Patterns
1.  **Result First**: "I managed to get [Result] using [Tool] in [Time]."
2.  **The Comparison Story**: "I tried [Tool A] for this task, but ran into [Problem]. Here's how [Tool B] handled it differently."
3.  **The Simple Question**: "If you're trying to choose between [Tool A] and [Tool B], there's one specific thing you need to see."

## 5. Branded Intro
