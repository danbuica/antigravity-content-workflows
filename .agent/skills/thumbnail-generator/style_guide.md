# Thumbnail Style Guide: "[Your Thumbnail Style]"

## 1. Visual Aesthetics
- **Vibe**: Tech-forward, high-contrast, cinematic, and authoritative.
- **Lighting**: "Natural Studio" key light on subject + Cool Teal rim light.
- **Background**:
    - **Base**: Deep Charcoal / Grid Black (#121212).
    - **Texture**: Faded screenshots of n8n workflows, code editors, or nodes (10-20% Opacity).
    - **Depth**: Subtle Teal glows (#00E5FF) behind subject/text.

## 2. Color Palette
- **Primary**: #121212 (Dark Background)
- **Accent 1 (Cool)**: #00E5FF (Teal - for depth, glows, tech elements)
- **Accent 2 (Warm)**: #FF6D00 (Orange - for arrows, highlights, urgent text)
- **Text**: White (#FFFFFF) or Light Grey (#E0E0E0).

## 3. Typography & Layout
- **Font**: Bold, modern Sans-Serif (e.g., Roboto, Inter). Clean and readable.
- **Placement**: VARIABLE. Mix of:
    - **Split**: Text Left / Subject Right.
    - **Center**: Subject Center / Text Split Top & Bottom.
    - ** asymmetrical**: Off-center focus.

## 4. Subject & Elements
- **Subject**: @[your-handle]. Natural expression (ranges from "Focus" to "Shock" based on idea).
- **Logos**: Optional but recommended for "Tool Specific" videos (n8n, OpenAI, etc.).
- **Graphics**: High-quality 3D icons, glass-morphism panels, or connection lines.
